Multiversal Interfaces - Executor Header Parser
===============================================

This repository contains a program that parses header files from Executor
and convers them to an intermediate (YAML) representation.

As Executor was a clean-room implementation of MacOS and is now available
under a liberal license, the resulting files are freely redistributable.
The companion repository `multiversal` contains the YAML files as well as
scripts for generating actual headers and libraries.
